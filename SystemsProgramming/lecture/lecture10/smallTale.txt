THIS IS NEW MSG FROM LSEEK! was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness
it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of light it was the season of darkness
it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair
we had everything before us we had nothing before us
we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct
the other wayin short the period was so far like the present
period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree
of comparison only;klfma;kfmak;mf;alsfm

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face
on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and
a queen with a fair face on the throne of france  in both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state
preserves of loaves and fishes that things in general were
settled for ever

it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventyfive  spiritual revelations were conceded to england at
that favoured period as at this  mrs southcott had recently
attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthday of whom a
prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime
appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the
swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cocklane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years after rapping
out its messages as the spirits of this very year last past
supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs
mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to
the english crown and people from a congress of british subjects
in america  which strange to relate have proved more important
to the human race than any communications yet received through
any of the chickens of the cocklane brood;lakds;lask

france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
her sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding
smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it
under the guidance of her christian pastors she entertained
herself besides with such humane achievements as sentencing
a youth to have his hands cut off his tongue torn out with
pincers and his body burned alive because he had not kneeled
down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or
sixty yards  it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of
france and norway there were growing trees when that sufferer
was put to death already marked by the woodman fate to come
down and be sawn into boards to make a certain movable framework
with a sack and a knife in it terrible in history  it is likely
enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
lands adjacent to paris there were sheltered from the weather
that very day rude carts bespattered with rustic mire snuffed
about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which the farmer death
had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution
but that woodman and that farmer though they work unceasingly
work silently and no one heard them as they went about with
muffled tread  the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous
